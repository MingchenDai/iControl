### Project Overview

iControl is developed as part of an academic assignment for the *Introduction to Engineering* course. The project aims to implement a **remote switch control system** using **Bluetooth Technology**. 

#### Key Components

- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module** for communication between the Android phone and the microcontroller.

- **STM32F103C8T6 Microcontroller** for control and signal processing.

- **Servo Machines** for physical operations.

- **3D-Printed Enclosure** to house the hardware components.

Both the **Android application source code** and the **STM32 control solution** have been uploaded to GitHub.

### Features

- **Bluetooth Communication**: Reliable communication via the **HC-05** Bluetooth module.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed according to the [SJTU UI Standards](https://developer.sjtu.edu.cn/form/standard/pageStyle.html), ensuring a clean and professional appearance.
- **Cross-Compatible**: Works on Android devices and Harmony OS versions below 4.2.0.

### Installation

To build and run the project, you need:

- **Android Studio**, latest stable version recommended
- **An Android device** (Harmony OS below 4.2.0 supported)

You should clone the repository and open the folder in Android Studio.
